Hello Lovely Ladies 

We are going to have lots of fun :octocat: :purple_heart: :sparkles: 

Use _this ReadMe_ to add useful links! 

Use _issues_ to create to do lists for our team! 

I will do a lesson on using **.git** and **GitHub** in the first 30 minutes of hacking so we can create our branches and local versions of our project :sparkles: Yay!
